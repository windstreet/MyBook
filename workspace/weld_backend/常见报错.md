## Q:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: 
When initializing mapper Mapper|StockSKUBatchFlowAdjustment|stock_sku_batch_flow_adjustment, 
expression 'assoc_stock_warehouse_order_x_flow' failed to locate a name ("name 'assoc_stock_warehouse_order_x_flow' is not defined"). 
If this is a class name, consider adding this relationship() to 
the <class 'bapi.modules.stock.flows.models.StockSKUBatchFlowAdjustment'> class after both dependent classes have been defined.
```

## A:
```bash
find /Users/admin/Desktop/workplace/weld_backend -name "*.pyc" | xargs rm -rf
```
